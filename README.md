# Discord RPG

This is intended to be a fully-fledged RPG, playable exclusively by using Discord Messaging. For this, I am using [Discord's API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro), but more specifically [DiscordRB](https://github.com/discordrb/discordrb). I chose Ruby for two reasons: It is easy to quickly create what I want, and I am most comfortable writing in Ruby.

## Why Discord?

I chose to make this a Discord bot based game simply because I love writing Discord bots and I have a pretty active Discord server with my friends. This is basically the only reason, as the game would just be a terminal based text adventure otherwise.

## Plans

* Add quest log
* Add battle system
	* Fine tune damage calculation
* Add rewards system
* Improve player inventory system
* Add player level up system
* Create item variants
* Create very basic art for Discord bot to output
* More stuff planned, but these are the pressing goals
(As a lofty goal, I plan on adding fishing and farming minigames)
